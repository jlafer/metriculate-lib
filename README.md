# metriculate-lib
This is a temporary library for Metriculate-common helper functions. It is locally referenced right now rather than from npmjs.com.
Eventually, the network functions will be removed from here and using code will get them from my generic jlafer-lib, after some refactoring.

## Installation

Currently, projects that use this library must put a `github` dependency in `package.json` like so:
```
 "metriculate-lib": "github:jlafer/metriculate-lib"
```

In the future, installation will be standardized like so:
npm install metriculate-lib
